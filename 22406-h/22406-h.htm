It was, when, crowding round the traveller,<br />
They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes, flung<br />
Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks,<br />
And, of the light wreaths of his smoking breath,<br />
Wove a white fringe for his brown beard, and laughed<br />
Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin<br /></div>

Among these Little People of the Snow!<br />
To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire,<br />
And the soft south wind was the wind of death.<br />
Away they flew, all with a pretty scowl<br />
Upon their childish faces, to the north,<br />

And there defied their enemy, the Spring;<br />
Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks,<br /></div>

Within the cottage, all prepared to dare<br />
The outer cold, with ample furry robe<br />

Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek.<br /></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

"For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well,<br />
Go not upon the snow beyond the spot<br />
Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field."<br /><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little maiden promised, and went forth,</span><br />
And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost<br />
Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>Into the hollows. Once, as up a drift<br />
She slowly rose, before her, in the way,<br />
She saw a little creature lily-cheeked,<br />
With flowing flaxen locks, and faint blue eyes,<br />
That gleamed like ice, and robe that only seemed<br />
Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek.<br />
On a smooth bank she sat.<br /></div>

<div class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Alice.</i>&mdash;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She must have been</span><br />
One of your Little People of the Snow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Uncle John.</i>&mdash;She was so, and, as Eva now drew near</span><br />
The tiny creature bounded from her seat;<br />
"And come," she said, "my pretty friend; to-day<br />
We will be playmates. I have watched thee long,<br />
And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts,<br />
And scoop their fair sides into little cells,<br />
And carve them with quaint figures, huge-limbed men,<br />
Lions, and griffins. We will have, to-day,<br />
A merry ramble over these bright fields,<br />
And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On went the pair, until they reached the bound</span><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow,<br />
Up to the lower branches. "Here we stop,"<br />
Said Eva, "for my mother has my word<br />
That I will go no further than this tree."<br />
Then the snow-maiden laughed: "And what is this?<br />
This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow,<br />
That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam<br />
For leagues beyond this garden, and return<br />
In safety; here the grim wolf never prowls,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>And here the eagle of our mountain-crags<br />
Preys not in winter. I will show the way<br />
And bring thee safely home. Thy mother, sure,<br />
Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By such smooth words was Eva won to break</span><br />
Her promise, and went on with her new friend,<br />
Over the glistening snow and down a bank<br />
Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind,<br />
Like to a billow's crest in the great sea,<br />
Curtained an opening. "Look, we enter here."<br />
And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold,<br />
Entered the little pair that hill of snow,<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>Walking along a passage with white walls,<br />
And a white vault above where snow-stars shed<br />
A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe,<br />
And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled,<br />
And talked and tripped along, as, down the way,<br />
Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the white walls widened, and the vault</span><br />
Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral dome,<br />
Such as the Florentine, who bore the name<br />
Of heaven's most potent angel, reared, long since,<br />
Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane,<br />
The glory of Burgos. Here a garden lay,<br />
In which the Little People of the Snow<br />
Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks<br />
Upon the mountain's side and in the clouds<br />
Were ended. Here they taught the silent frost<br />
To mock, in stem and spray, and leaf and flower,<br /></div>

Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs,<br />
Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak<br />
Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

Fast anchored, in the glistening bank; light sprays<br />
Of myrtle, roses in their bud and bloom,<br />
Drooped by the winding walks; yet all seemed wrought<br />
Of stainless alabaster; up the trees<br />
Ran the lithe jessamine, with stalk and leaf<br />
Colorless as her flowers. "Go softly on,"<br />
Said the snow-maiden; "touch not, with thy hand,<br />
The frail creation round thee, and beware<br />
To sweep it with thy skirts. Now look above.<br />
How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up<br />
With shifting gleams that softly come and go!<br />
These are the northern lights, such as thou seest<br />
In the midwinter nights, cold, wandering flames,<br />
That float, with our processions, through the air;<br />
And here, within our winter palaces,<br />
Mimic the glorious daybreak." Then she told<br />
How, when the wind, in the long winter nights,<br />
Swept the light snows into the hollow dell,<br />
She and her comrades guided to its place<br />
Each wandering flake, and piled them quaintly up,<br />
In shapely colonnade and glistening arch,<br />
With shadowy aisles between, or bade them grow<br /></div>

Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks<br />
In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all,<br />
Built the broad roof. "But thou hast yet to see<br />
A fairer sight," she said, and led the way<br />
To where a window of pellucid ice<br />
Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path.<br />
"Look, but thou mayst not enter." Eva looked,<br /></div>

Stripes of soft light, ruddy, and delicate green,<br />

And streaming banners, to that place had brought<br />
Their radiant flags to grace a festival.<br /></div>

Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared,<br />
Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds,<br />
That rang from cymbals of transparent ice,<br />
And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch<br />
Of little fingers. Round and round they flew,<br />
As when, in spring, about a chimney-top,<br />
A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,<br />
Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again,<br />
Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly<br />
Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance,<br />
Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked<br />
From under lily brows, and gauzy scarfs<br /></div>

And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight<br />
Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep<br />
Of motion as they passed her;&mdash;long she gazed,<br />
And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled<br />
The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold<br />
Recalled her to herself. "Too long, too long<br />
I linger here," she said, and then she sprang<br />
Into the path, and with a hurried step<br />
Followed it upward. Ever by her side<br />
Her little guide kept pace. As on they went<br />
Eva bemoaned her fault: "What must they think&mdash;<br />
The dear ones in the cottage, while so long,<br />
Hour after hour, I stay without? I know<br />
That they will seek me far and near, and weep<br />

The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt<br />
In the mid path. "Father! forgive this sin;<br />
Forgive myself I cannot"&mdash;thus she prayed,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
And rose and hastened onward. When, at last,<br />
They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed<br />
A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread,<br />
But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt<br />
The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy,<br /></div>

And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift,<br />
And danced round Eva, as she labored up<br />
The mounds of snow, "Ah me! I feel my eyes<br />
Grow heavy," Eva said; "they swim with sleep;<br />
I cannot walk for utter weariness,<br />
And I must rest a moment on this bank,<br />
But let it not be long." As thus she spoke,<br />
In half-formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,<br />
With closing lids. Her guide composed the robe<br />
About her limbs, and said, "A pleasant spot<br /></div>

Is this to slumber in; on such a couch<br />
Oft have I slept away the winter night,<br />
And had the sweetest dreams." So Eva slept,<br />
But slept in death; for when the power of frost<br />
Locks up the motions of the living frame,<br />
The victim passes to the realm of Death<br />
Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide,<br />
Watching beside her, saw the hues of life<br />
Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek,<br />
As fades the crimson from a morning cloud,<br />
Till they were white as marble, and the breath<br />
Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not<br />
At first that this was death. But when she marked<br />
How deep the paleness was, how motionless<br />
That once lithe form, a fear came over her.<br />
She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe,<br />
And shouted in her ear, but all in vain;<br />
The life had passed away from those young limbs.<br /></div>

Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw<br />
The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came,<br />
With gentle chidings ready on their lips,<br />
And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale<br />
Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell<br />
Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief<br />
And blame were uttered: "Cruel, cruel one,<br />
To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,<br />
Who suffered her to wander forth alone<br />
In this fierce cold." They lifted the dear child,<br />
And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,<br /></div>

To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath<br />
Back to her bosom; fruitlessly they strove.<br />
The little maid was dead. In blank despair<br />
They stood, and gazed at her who never more<br />
Should look on them. "Why die we not with her?"<br />
They said; "without her life is bitterness."<br /></div>

Of all that pastoral region gathered round,<br />
To share the sorrow of the cottagers.<br />
They carved a way into the mound of snow<br />
To the glen's side, and dug a little grave<br />
In the smooth slope, and, following the bier,<br />
In long procession from the silent door,<br />
Chanted a sad and solemn melody.<br /></div>
